# Tank-Go-V5 (Table Tank)
The project is build on Linkit-7697 and Robot-Shield-V2.0 board
It support LBT and Wi-Fi connections on IOS and Android of mobileibility devices to control it
The Robot shield is extend board with 2 of 750F capacitor as batteries and full charge by 30-40 mins  

I would like to call it as "Table Tank" instead - It is very funny to play with family and friends.

For this update version are based on personal preference, include:
  - Optimize the RC lanscape and those buttons on left and right side 
  - Add MP3 play list up to 15 songs on middle of screen 
  - Insert "Backfill AMMO" message when bullets is zero and player still push fire button

  - The user button on LinkIT7697 board is functionalify testing purpose. It will show AMMO and life alarm 
    message and light and swap those 2 external LED indicators by each 0.5 seconds and test IR singal workable as well
  
  Attentions
    - The AMMO indicator connect P15 pin to Robot shield and the 2nd IR LED had move to P3 pin. 
      If you adopt the dual turret on your tank and connect the 2nd IR LED from original P15 IR LED had to plug 
      into P3 pin on robot shield board   
    - Need manual cut pice of Turret supporter as screwdriver show it on attach picture before plug connector to P3 pin
    - Please create mp3 folder on TF card then insert to DFPLAYER module. 
    - The github package include system voice which reserved by 0001 - 0010. 
      If you want to put your prefer songs then the file name will go from 0011 - 0025.mp3 by sequence.
